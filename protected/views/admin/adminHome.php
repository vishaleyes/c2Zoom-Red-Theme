				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PMD is an internet based
				application service provider, whose purpose is to store confidential
				medical information and documents in a maximally secure hosted
				environment and provide a platform on which transactions of daily
				living can be accomplished in a safe but virtually effortless
				fashion.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial
				focus and driving force for PM [x] is the medical records revenue
				stream, which is intended to be a consumer owned and operated
				complete medical record, which includes not only all pertinent
				medical information about an individual (and their family), but his
				actual x-rays, laboratory results, health care directives, organ
				donation status and preventative health alerts.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial service model
				to be provided will be patient oriented vs. provider oriented. The
				principle intention is to give responsibility and control of medical
				information, in a simple and convenient way, to the consumer, to
				best ensure responsible involvement in a patients medical treatment.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise for this
				service is that well informed patients make better decisions leading
				to a higher quality of care, fewer complications, more cost
				effective health care management, and reduced early mortality.
